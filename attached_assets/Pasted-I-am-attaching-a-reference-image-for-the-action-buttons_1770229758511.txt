I am attaching a reference image for the action buttons design.

Your task is to TRANSFORM my existing website UI so the action buttons and interaction style match the reference image EXACTLY in terms of layout, spacing, gradients, and modern mobile-first appearance.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT rebuild the site.
Do NOT break existing functionality.
Only upgrade the UI/UX and interaction flow.

-------------------------------------

⭐ ACTION BUTTON SYSTEM (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Redesign the profile section to include a modern action dashboard using the reference style.

Buttons must look soft, premium, rounded, and slightly elevated with subtle shadows and gradients.

Create the following buttons:

1️⃣ Book a Call  
• Large gradient button  
• Include a visible "30 mins" indicator next to it  
• Make this the PRIMARY CTA  
• It must visually dominate the section  

2️⃣ Call  
• Circular icon button  

3️⃣ WhatsApp  
• Circular icon button  

4️⃣ Social Links  
• Instagram icon  
• LinkedIn icon  

5️⃣ Email  
• Icon button matching the same style  

👉 ALL action buttons MUST appear inside the profile dashboard so they can be easily managed or edited later.

Maintain consistent spacing between buttons.

Follow the same visual softness seen in the reference image.

-------------------------------------

⭐ MOBILE vs DESKTOP

MOBILE:
Match the reference design closely.
Buttons should feel touch-friendly with generous padding.

DESKTOP:
Use the EXACT same design language — do NOT switch to outdated rectangular buttons.

Keep the modern floating style.

-------------------------------------

⭐ REQUEST FORM FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)

Remove the current request form behavior.

NEW FLOW:

When a user taps "Book a Call":

→ Open a smooth in-page form (modal or slide-up panel).  
→ After submission, redirect the user directly to WhatsApp — similar to an Airbnb-style checkout flow.

The process must feel fast, guided, and frictionless.

Avoid sending users to separate ugly pages.

-------------------------------------

⭐ AUTO-SCROLL SECTION

Create a horizontally auto-scrolling section titled:

"Latest Deals Closed"

Requirements:

• Smooth continuous scroll  
• Pause on hover  
• Mobile swipe enabled  
• Premium card design  
• Not crowded  

This section should build trust instantly.

-------------------------------------

⭐ PROPERTY CARD FIXES

Improve alignment and spacing across all property cards.

Fix inconsistent padding and text placement.

Remove the small image icon currently placed in the top-right corner of property cards.

Instead:

✅ Bring back the clear "Rent" or "Sale" badge like the previous version.  
✅ Make badges more visible and premium.  

Ensure every card has breathing room.

The layout must feel organized and high-end — NOT like a crowded marketplace grid.

-------------------------------------

⭐ GLOBAL ALIGNMENT

Review the entire page and correct:

• spacing inconsistencies  
• misaligned elements  
• uneven margins  
• cramped sections  

Increase whitespace where needed.

Luxury design always breathes.

-------------------------------------

⭐ FINAL DESIGN GOAL

The interface should feel like a premium personal brand platform — NOT a generic property listing website.

When users land on the page, the immediate impression should be:

"This agent operates at a higher level."

After completing the changes, review the UI once more and refine typography, spacing, and button hierarchy to ensure everything looks modern, soft, and premium.
