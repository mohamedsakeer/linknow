1️⃣ PROFILE HEADER (KEEP STRUCTURE, IMPROVE CLARITY)
Must have (already present – keep):
Circular profile photo
Agent full name (bold)
Short bio line (1 sentence max)
“Verified Agent” badge
Location pill (e.g., Business Bay)
Add (mandatory):
Below bio line, add small helper text:
“Tap any property to chat with me instantly on WhatsApp”
Style:
Small, light grey text

Non-clickable
Do not make it visually dominant
2️⃣ SECTION TITLE COPY (REPLACE GENERIC TEXT)
Replace:
FEATURED PROPERTIES
With ONE of the following (pick one, make configurable later):

“Handpicked Listings”
“Homes You Can Enquire About”
“Properties You Can Message Me About”
Rules:

3️⃣ PROPERTY CARD STRUCTURE (REFINE, DO NOT REBUILD)
Keep existing:
Image carousel with counter (1/4)
Rent / Sale badge
Property type pill (Apartment)
Price
Location
Icons: beds, baths, size
Card layout, rounded corners, spacing
Improve (mandatory):
A. Add contextual micro-text below price:
For Rent:
Yearly • Ready to move
For Sale:
Freehold • Serious buyers only
Style:
Small text
Grey color
Single line only
B. Reduce visual dominance of pills:
Keep both “Rent/Sale” and “Apartment”
Make one lighter (lower opacity or lighter background)
Primary focus order must be: Image → Price → WhatsApp CTA
4️⃣ WHATSAPP CTA (VERY IMPORTANT)
Replace button text:
From: WhatsApp
To one of the following:
“Chat on WhatsApp”
“Enquire on WhatsApp”
“Ask About This Home”
“Message Me on WhatsApp”
(Default to “Chat on WhatsApp”)
Add micro-helper text ABOVE button:
One line only:
“Instant reply on WhatsApp”
OR “No forms. Direct WhatsApp chat.”
Style:
Small
Grey
Non-clickable
WhatsApp behavior (MANDATORY):
Clicking WhatsApp opens pre-filled message
Message must include:
Property type
Rent/Sale
Location
Price
Example format:
Hi Mohamed, I’m interested in the 2-bedroom apartment for rent in Jumeirah Beach listed at 123,800 AED. Please share more details.
5️⃣ STICKY WHATSAPP BAR (MOBILE ONLY – REQUIRED)
Add fixed bottom bar on mobile:
Text:
“Chat with Mohamed on WhatsApp”
Behavior:
Opens WhatsApp with generic intro message
Not property-specific
Always visible while scrolling
Does NOT hide property buttons
Generic message:
Hi Mohamed, I found your Linknow page and would like to enquire about your available properties.
6️⃣ USER EXPERIENCE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
Must NOT add:
❌ Contact forms
❌ Email buttons
❌ Phone call buttons
❌ Booking forms
❌ Filters or search
❌ Social media icons
❌ Share clutter
❌ Login or signup for visitors
This is not a listing portal.
This is a conversion page to WhatsApp.
7️⃣ DESIGN & FEEL (IMPORTANT)
White background
Generous spacing
Rounded cards
Soft shadows
Airbnb-level cleanliness
No aggressive colors except WhatsApp green
No heavy borders
No dark themes
Page must feel:
Premium, modern, calm, trustworthy
8️⃣ PERFORMANCE & BEHAVIOR
Page must load fast on mobile
Images lazy-loaded
WhatsApp links must never break
No modals, no popups
Scroll must feel smooth and light
9️⃣ FINAL PRODUCT GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
User flow must be:
Open link from Instagram bio
Trust the agent in 3 seconds
Scroll listings
Tap WhatsApp
Start conversation
Anything that does not support this flow must be removed or avoided.
❗ FINAL NOTE TO DEVELOPER
Do not:
Over-engineer
Add “nice to have” features
Think like a portal
Think like:
“One tap from Instagram → WhatsApp conversation”
Build exactly that.
