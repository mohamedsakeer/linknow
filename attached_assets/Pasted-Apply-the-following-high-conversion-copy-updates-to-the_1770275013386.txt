Apply the following high-conversion copy updates to the existing LinkNow landing page. Do NOT redesign the page. Do NOT change layout structure. Only replace the specified text and remove unnecessary friction. Maintain a minimal, premium, high-trust design suitable for commission-driven real estate professionals. Avoid adding new sections, colors, or visual clutter.

✅ HERO SECTION (CRITICAL CHANGES)
1. Remove Technical-Sounding Language

Delete any usage of the following terms across the page:

Lead Engine

Funnel

Bio Tool

Link in Bio

These create confusion or reduce perceived value.

Focus ONLY on outcomes.

2. FINAL HEADLINE (Do NOT Modify Further)

Replace the hero headline with:

Turn Instagram Traffic Into Serious Property Buyers — Not “Hi / Hello” Messages.

Make “Not ‘Hi / Hello’ Messages” visually dominant:

Larger font

Bold

High contrast

This is the emotional hook.

3. FINAL SUBHEADLINE (Use Exactly This)

Built specifically for Dubai real estate agents to turn Instagram traffic into qualified buyers.
Know what the buyer wants before the conversation even starts.

No extra sentences.

No jargon.

Clarity wins.

4. Remove the Signup Form From the Hero

If a phone number or input form exists above the fold, DELETE it.

Do not ask for contact details before intent.

Use a 2-step conversion flow:

User clicks CTA → then sees signup.

This increases conversions significantly.

5. Add Micro Trust Text Under Primary CTA

Directly below “Get My Lead Engine” button, add:

Founder-led setup. Live in minutes.

Keep the font small but readable.

Purpose: eliminate perceived effort.

✅ FOUNDING OFFER SECTION (Authority Upgrade)

Replace:

Limited to the first 50 agents.

WITH:

Once 50 agents join, this offer disappears.

This signals demand instead of desperation.

Maintain confident tone.

No soft wording.

✅ “WHY SERIOUS AGENTS ARE SWITCHING” SECTION

Replace the THIRD bullet completely.

DELETE:

Operate like a top-tier agent.

ADD:

Stand out instantly from agents still sending buyers to raw WhatsApp.
Your clients expect a professional experience — not messaging chaos.

This introduces competitive tension, which improves conversions.

✅ LIVE EXAMPLE SECTION (Trust Optimization)

Change label from:

Live Dubai Agent Example

TO:

See a Real Agent Page — Not a Demo

The word “demo” lowers trust.
“Real” increases safety perception.

Do not alter layout.

✅ FOUNDER STRIP (Authority Boost)

Replace founder text with:

Built by a founder who understands how Dubai agents generate inbound buyers — personally onboarding the first users.

Use the phrase inbound buyers, not leads.

Revenue language performs better.

✅ GLOBAL DESIGN RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

Do NOT add testimonials yet

Do NOT add feature grids

Do NOT write long paragraphs

Do NOT introduce startup buzzwords

Do NOT clutter the interface

Do NOT redesign sections

Keep the page calm, sharp, and confident.

This product is professional infrastructure — the page must feel that way.

✅ UX RULE (IMPORTANT)

Only show signup fields AFTER a user clicks a CTA.

Never before.

Reduce friction wherever possible.

END PROMPT.
