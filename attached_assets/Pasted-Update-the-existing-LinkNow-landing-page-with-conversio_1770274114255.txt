Update the existing LinkNow landing page with conversion-focused improvements. Do NOT redesign the page. Do NOT change the layout drastically. Only apply the following surgical changes. Keep the design minimal, premium, and high-trust. Avoid adding new sections or visual clutter.

HERO SECTION FIXES (VERY IMPORTANT)
1. REMOVE the signup form from the hero section.

Delete the phone number / input form completely from above the fold.

Reason: Asking for contact details too early creates friction and reduces conversions.

Replace the form with clean spacing or visual balance.

Users should click a CTA first before seeing any form.

2. Increase Visual Dominance of This Phrase:

Not “Hi / Hello” Messages

Make it:

Larger than the rest of the headline

Higher contrast

Bold

This is the emotional hook. It must visually punch.

3. Replace the Subheadline With This Exact Copy:

Built specifically for Dubai agents who are serious about closing.
Qualify buyers before the conversation even starts.

This adds status psychology and filters for professionals.

4. Add Micro Trust Text Under Primary CTA:

Place directly below “Get My Lead Engine” button:

Founder-led setup. Live in minutes.

Keep it small but visible.

Purpose: removes time-friction anxiety.

FOUNDING OFFER SECTION UPGRADE

Replace:

Limited to the first 50 agents.

WITH:

Once 50 agents join, this offer disappears.

This signals demand instead of hope.

Maintain confident tone.

No soft language.

“WHY SERIOUS AGENTS ARE SWITCHING” SECTION FIX

Replace the THIRD bullet completely.

DELETE:

Operate like a top-tier agent.

REPLACE WITH:

Stand out instantly from agents still sending buyers to raw WhatsApp.

Supporting line:

Your clients expect a professional experience — not messaging chaos.

This introduces competitive fear, which increases conversions.

LIVE EXAMPLE SECTION IMPROVEMENT

Change label from:

Live Dubai Agent Example

TO:

See a Real Agent Page — Not a Demo

Reason: The word “demo” lowers trust.
“Real” increases safety perception.

Do not change layout.

FOUNDER STRIP AUTHORITY BOOST

Replace the founder text with:

Built by a founder who understands how Dubai agents generate inbound buyers — personally onboarding the first users.

Use the phrase inbound buyers, not leads.

Revenue language converts better.

GLOBAL RULES (DO NOT BREAK THESE)

Do NOT add testimonials yet

Do NOT add feature grids

Do NOT add long paragraphs

Do NOT use startup buzzwords

Do NOT clutter the page

Do NOT introduce new colors

Maintain a calm, premium, high-competence feel.

This product is infrastructure for commission-driven professionals — the page must reflect that.

IMPORTANT UX RULE

When a user clicks Get My Lead Engine, THEN show the signup / phone capture.

Never before intent.

Use a 2-step conversion flow.
