I already have a live website design.

I am attaching a reference image that represents the EXACT design direction I want.

Your task is to REDESIGN my existing website UI to visually match the reference style while keeping my current functionality.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT rebuild from scratch.
Do NOT change my backend logic.
Only transform the UI/UX.

Treat the reference image as the visual benchmark for:

• layout  
• spacing  
• hierarchy  
• typography  
• button styles  
• card design  
• colors  
• overall premium feel  

Do NOT copy it blindly — adapt my content into that design language.

------------------------------------

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Make my website look like a HIGH-END personal brand instead of a property marketplace.

Shift the focus from property listings → to the agent.

------------------------------------

TOP SECTION (HERO)

Redesign my hero section to match the reference style:

• Large centered profile image  
• Cleaner background  
• More whitespace  
• Strong typography  

Remove visual clutter.

Add a dominant modern CTA button such as:

"Book a Call" or "Book a Private Consultation"

Make this the strongest visual element.

Properties should NOT dominate the first screen.

------------------------------------

LAYOUT CHANGES

Reduce the crowded property grid.

Show fewer cards with more spacing.

Make the interface breathe.

Adopt the layered card style seen in the reference image.

Use rounded corners and soft shadows.

------------------------------------

VISUAL STYLE

Apply a modern premium aesthetic:

• soft gradients  
• subtle shadows  
• elegant colors  
• minimal dividers  
• large readable text  

Avoid anything that looks like a template.

Avoid bright broker-style colors.

The design should feel calm, expensive, and professional.

------------------------------------

TYPOGRAPHY

Improve hierarchy using larger font sizes.

Create clear contrast between:

headline  
subheadline  
section titles  
body text  

Do NOT compress text.

Luxury design uses space.

------------------------------------

CTA UPGRADE

Replace overly basic buttons with modern high-contrast buttons.

Add a sticky mobile CTA at the bottom for WhatsApp or booking.

Make buttons rounded with good padding.

------------------------------------

PROPERTY SECTION

After redesigning the hero:

Rebuild the property layout to match the cleaner style from the reference.

Use either:

• horizontal scrolling cards  
OR  
• a spaced 2-column grid  

Avoid tight layouts.

Each card should feel premium.

------------------------------------

FINAL DESIGN GOAL

When someone lands on the site, the immediate impression should be:

"This agent looks high-end and trustworthy."

NOT:

"This is just another listings page."

Push the design toward a luxury personal brand experience.

After completing the redesign, review it once more and refine spacing, typography, and hierarchy to ensure the interface feels premium and modern.
